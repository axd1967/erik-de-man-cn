This directory contains maps and charts, which are included in the Nautical Almanac pages 
(e.g. map of the world for plotting the path of totality for solar eclipses).
The format is very specific to the program reading the data and consist of one character-per-pixel

The resolution of the stored map is one pixel per 0.3 degrees of Longitude/Latitude.
The pixels are stored longitude-wise with 1200 pixel per latitude value (360/0.3) 
starting with 70 degrees North. A total of 470 lines of latitude (141/0.3) are available
downto to 70 degrees South. 

Each pixel is represented with one character. A "0" represents a "land" pixel;
a "1" represents a "sea" pixel. Total number of pixels is (1200 * 470) = 564000
