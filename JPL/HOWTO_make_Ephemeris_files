This HOWTO is a short introduction on how to generate binary ephemerides files from
the basic (ASCII) "DE405" ephemerides files published by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.


Background:

The "NOVAS" package is the software package which supplies the basic functions to
calculate the solar system ephemerides. But thes functions need an interface to a
basic ephemerides file, which is basically a numerical file with position and speed 
of the solar system objects at distinct time instances. The "NOVAS" basic functions
can obtain the ephemerides from interpolation of this raw data in time and space.
The problem with binary data is that they are stored in a way that depends on the
operating system of your computer (in contrast to ASCII data) and must be generated
with the same operarting system under which the data will be read.

The tools "convert" and "append" available from the "Source" subdirectory, will allow
to generate the binary "DE405" ephemerides files needed by the "NOVAS" functions
from the downloadable ASCII files published by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.


Procedure:

The basic "DE405" Ephemerides in ASCII format from 1600AD until 2200AD can be downloaded
from the JPL server. These "DE405" ephemerides are available in ASCII format, but have
to be converted and merged together in one binary file to make it usable for the "jplint"
routine.

This is how the binary ephemerides file can be generated using the "convert" and "append"
programms of David Hoffman:



First download the files "ascp2000.405", "ascp2020.405" and "header.405" from the JPL
server. The last file is a small header file describing the actual structure of the 
large ASCII ephemerides files.
Then convert both ASCII ephemerides files into a corresponding binary file with the
"convert" programm from the "Source" subdirectory:

% convert header.405 ascp2000.405 ascp2000.bin
% convert header.405 ascp2020.405 ascp2020.bin

Finally merge the binary files and rename the resulting binary ephemerides file:

% append ascp2000.bin ascp2020.bin
% rm ascp2020.bin
% mv ascp2000.bin JPLephemDE405.bin

The binary file "JPLephemDE405.bin" is read by my C-version of "jplint.c" and contains
the Tchebychev coefficients for the time span 2000 to 2040.
