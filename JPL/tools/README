This directory contains the source code and binaries of two tools
needed to generate the binary ephemerides file "../JPLephemDE405.bin"
in the parent directory. This is the basic ephemeris file for
generating the Nautical Almanac.



The two programms needed for this are:

 ./bin/convert   to convert individual ASCII ephemerides and
 ./bin/append    to merge converted binary ephemerides files

They can be compiled (with gcc) and installed by doing "make" in this
directory. You will need a current version of "make" and "gcc"
to succeed in doing this.


See also the "READMEfirst" file in the subdirectory "../ephemerides/"
for more details on how to generate binary ephemerides files with the
programms "convert" and "append" found under "./bin"



NOTICE:
The original utilities come from the package "EphemUtilVer1.0.tar.gz"
published 1999 by David Hoffman. This package can be downloaded from

ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/export/C-versions/hoffman/

(as of 19-Apr-2007).
