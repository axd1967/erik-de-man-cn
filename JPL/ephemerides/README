INTRODUCTION
------------

  The JPL Planetary and Lunar Ephemerides are available to outside users upon 
  request.  The package allows a professional user to obtain the rectangular
  coordinates of the sun, moon, and nine major planets by means of a simple 
  subroutine written in standard fortran.

  We suggest for the more casual user, JPL's interactive website and telnet
  service, "Horizons", which provides a wide variety of astronomical 
  information and which uses the full precision of our ephemerides.  See 
  the website,  "http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/".

  In fact, for information about many different kinds of ephemerides 
  (interactive, self-contained, high precision, etc.) see the following website:

         "http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/iau-comm4"

  and click on "Where to obtain ephemerides".  

  For those who truly need the high-precision, basic JPL ephemerides, there 
  are two methods of acquiring the ephemerides: 1) from this site via ftp and 
  2) via a CRrom from the publisher, Willmann-Bell (see Appendix B).

  The final goal of the installation process is the successful execution 
  of the main program "TESTEPH.F".  This program reads and interpolates 
  planetary and lunar coordinates from a binary direct-read ephemeris file 
  and compares these results against corresponding numbers produced at JPL.  
  "TESTEPH.F" uses the subroutines which are of eventual interest to the user.

  It is strongly suggested that a potential user first read through this
  README in its entirety.  This will provide an idea of what is involved in
  both the installation and in the usage of the ephemeris package.

This README contains the following sections;

*******************************************************************************

LOCATION
--------

The ephemeris package is available over Internet from the anonymous ftp server:

           navigator.jpl.nasa.gov [128.149.23.82].

  When connected, "cd ephem/export"

******************************************************************************

WHAT TO DO
----------

  Retrieve the items, listed in the next sections, from the anonymous ftp site.

  Read the "usrguide", especially the parts about "NRECL" and "KSIZE"
   
  [Note: For UNIX-based users, the ephemeris files are available in binary 
  form, ready for immediate installation on the user's computer.  For all 
  others, the ephemeris is supplied in ASCII format and must be converted 
  (a one-time only process) into binary format for installation; software 
  is supplied for this conversion.  (Sorry, we have tried to export binary 
  files for other types of platforms, but the lack of uniformity from one 
  computer and/or compiler to   the next made this too difficult.)  However, 
  I have received the following:
     "I have been able to read the unix binary files with no problem
     on my Mac, and I suspect that any machine that formats floating 
     point numbers in IEEE-754 (1985) format will be able to read them."]

******************************************************************************

CONTENTS TO BE RETRIEVED BY THE USER
------------------------------------

 ***  UNIX users: retrieve the following 7 items: 

                 (one is in the directory "/usr1/ftp/" upon entry)

          /usr1/ftp/ephem/export/usrguide
          /usr1/ftp/ephem/export/fortran/testeph.f
          /usr1/ftp/ephem/export/fortran/selcon.f
          /usr1/ftp/ephem/export/fortran/binmerge.f
          /usr1/ftp/ephem/export/fortran/binshort.f
          /usr1/ftp/ephem/export/unix/unxSYYYY.XXX  (multiple files)
          /usr1/ftp/ephem/export/test-data/testpo.XXX

     where "SYYYY" is the starting year of each particular ephemeris block 
     ("S" is the sign : "p" for + and "m" for -) and "XXX" is the ephemeris 
     number: 200, 403, 405 or 406.  See choices below for the different 
     ephemerides.

     The UNIX binary files come in 50-year blocks (3.8-4.7 Mbytes each, 
     depending upon the ephemeris).  Once they are installed on the user's 
     computer, contiguous blocks may be merged together to form a single 
     ephemeris file; this is done using "binmerge.f".

 ***  non-UNIX users: retrieve the following 9 items:

                 (one is in the directory :/usr1/ftp/" upon entry)

          /usr1/ftp/ephem/export/usrguide
          /usr1/ftp/ephem/export/fortran/testeph.f
          /usr1/ftp/ephem/export/fortran/selcon.f
          /usr1/ftp/ephem/export/fortran/asc2eph.f
          /usr1/ftp/ephem/export/fortran/binmerge.f
          /usr1/ftp/ephem/export/fortran/binshort.f
          /usr1/ftp/ephem/export/ascii/ascSYYYY.XXX  (multiple files)
          /usr1/ftp/ephem/export/ascii/header.XXX
          /usr1/ftp/ephem/export/test-data/testpo.XXX

     where "SYYYY" is the starting year of each particular ephemeris block
     ("S" is the sign : "p" for + and "m" for -) and "XXX" is the ephemeris
     number: 200, 403, 405, or 406.  See choices below for different 
     ephemerides.

     The ASCII files come in 20-year blocks (about 3.5 Mbytes each). The 
     blocks are converted into binary blocks on the user's computer, using 
     "asc2eph.f"; then, contiguous binary blocks may be merged together to 
     form a single ephemeris file using "binmerge.f"; or, a smaller portion 
     of an ephemeris file may be extracted from a larger file using 
     "binshort.f".

******************************************************************************

BRIEF ITEM DESCRIPTION
-----------------------

  "usrguide"     : User's Guide containing instructions for obtaining and using
                   the ephemerides, including the usage of the subroutines and 
                   the testing of the software package.
                      
  "testeph"      : Software Package containing a main program which uses the 
                   reading and interpolating subroutines.  This program 
                   compares the results with similar runs made at JPL in order 
                   to ensure that the ephemeris is installed and being read 
                   correctly.
                   

                   The reading and interpolating subroutines included in 
                   "testeph", along with the ephemeris file(s) themselves, are 
                   the items which are of eventual interest to the user.
                   

  "testpo"       : Test results computed at JPL; these are input by the program
                   "testeph" and are used for testing the ephemeris 
                   installation.  There is a different "testpo" for each 
                   different ephemeris; they must match or the test will not 
                   work correctly.

  "binmerge"     : Program to merge two adjoining binary ephemerides.

  "binshort"     : Program to extract a portion of an ephemeris from a larger 
                   file.


  for UNIX users
  --------------

  "unxSYYYY.XXX" : Binary ephemeris files from JPL Ephemeris DEXXX, covering 50
                   years, starting in the year SYYYY ("p/m" for "+/-").  The 
                   pieces may be used separately, or the 50-year files 
                   (300-year files for DE406) may be merged into a single 
                   ephemeris file using the program, "binmerge.f".  Also, a 
                   shorter-span ephemeris may be extracted from a longer one 
                   using the program, "binshort.f".
                   

  for non-UNIX users
  --------------

  "asc2eph.f"    : A one-time conversion program which converts the ephemeris 
                   from ASCII format into binary form. 
                           
  "ascSYYYY.XXX" : ASCII ephemeris files from JPL Ephemeris DEXXX, each 
                   covering 20 years, starting in the year SYYYY ("p/m" for 
                   "+/-").  The 20-year blocks may be converted separately 
                   into binary ephemeris files using "asc2eph" or they may 
                   be combined into a single ASCII files and then converted 
                   into a single binary file.  Subsequently, separate binary 
                   files may be merged into a single ephemeris file using
                   the program, "binmerge.f".  Also, a shorter-span ephemeris 
                   may be extracted from a longer one using the program, 
                   "binshort.f".

  "header.XXX" : Header information for ephemeris deXXX, needed by "asc2eph.f".

AVAILABLE EPHEMERIDES
---------------------

DE200 : (includes nutations but not librations)

     JED 2305424.5 (1599 DEC 09)  to  JED 2513360.5  (2169 MAR 31)

     This ephemeris has been the basis of the Astronomical Almanac since 
     1984.  It is based upon the dynamical equator and equinox of J2000 
     (see Standish, 1982 and Standish, 1990).

DE403 : (includes nutations but not librations)

     JED 2433264.5 (1949 DEC 14)  to  JED 2469808.5 (2050 JAN 02)

     Kept available since it has been a standard for the IERS and has
     been used by others in the past.

DE405 : (includes both nutations and librations)

     JED 2305424.50  (1599 DEC 09)  to  JED 2525008.50  (2201 FEB 20)

     Our latest ephemeris; it is based upon the International Celestial 
     Reference Frame (ICRF).  (DE200 is within 0.01 arcseconds of the frame 
     of the ICRF).  DE405 was created in May-June 1997.

DE406 : the New "JPL Long Ephemeris" (includes neither nutations nor 
        librations)

     Note:  DE406 is available only in unix on the ftp site.  

     JED 0624976.50 (-3001 FEB 04) to 2816912.50 (+3000 MAY 06)

     This is the same ephemeris as DE405, though the accuracy of the 
     interpolating polynomials has been lessened (interpolation on the 
     64-day mesh points remains exact, however).  For DE406/LE406, the 
     interpolating accuracy is no worse than 25 meters for any planet and 
     no worse than 1 meter for the moon.

     DE406 requires about 10 megabytes for each 300-year block.

SOFTWARE DESCRIPTION
--------------------

The software package (apart from the programs used to initially construct the
ephemeris, asc2eph, binmerge, and binshort) consists of a main test program 
which uses the reading and interpolating routines in order to retrieve the 
ephemeris data and to compare the results against the Test Data.  

Two of the subroutines called by testeph.f are of primary interest to the user:
"PLEPH" and "SELCON".  Three others, "CONST", "DPLEPH", and "STATE" may also be
useful.

   PLEPH  :  Get the state vector (position and velocity) of one body with 
              respect to another at any given time within the interval covered 
              by the ephemeris.

   SELCON :  Retrieve values of user-requested constants on the ephemeris file.
 
   CONST  :  Retrieve values of all of the constants on the ephemeris file.

   DPLEPH :  Same as PLEPH, but with increased precision in the input time.

   STATE  :  Read and interpolate the ephemeris file. (Called by PLEPH).

******************************************************************************

SOFTWARE USAGE
--------------

C  NOTE : Over the years, different versions of PLEPH have had a 5th argument:
C  sometimes, an error return statement number; sometimes, a logical denoting
C  whether or not the requested date is covered by the ephemeris.  We apologize
C  for this inconsistency; in this version, we use only the four necessary
C  arguments and do the testing outside of the subroutine.

**  STATE  ********  subroutine state(jed,list,pv,nut,*)  **********
           
  [This subroutine is identical to that provided in the past; it is still 
   provided to give previous users compatability; it is not recommended for 
   use by first-time users.]
                                                                     
**  DPLEPH  ********  entry dpleph( tdb2, npl, nctr, pv)  **********

  This entry is identical to "PLEPH", except that the input time, tdb2, is
  doubly-dimensioned for increased precision  [ double precision tdb2(2) ].

                          Any combination of tdb2(1)+tdb2(2) which falls within
                          the time span on the file is a permissible epoch.    
                                                                               
                          For ease in programming, the user may put the entire 
                          date into tdb2(1) and set tdb2(2)=0.        

                          However, for maximum interpolation accuracy, set 
                          tdb2(1) equal to the most recent midnight at or 
                          before interpolation epoch (i.e., xxxxxxx.5d0) and 
                          set tdb2(2) equal to the remaining fractional part 
                          of the day.

                          As an alternative, it may prove convenient to set 
                          tdb2(1) equal to some fixed epoch, such as start of 
                          integration, and set tdb2(2) equal to the remainder 
                          of the desired epoch.

On the first record of an export binary file or in the "GROUP 1050 of the ascii

13th of each set are stored away from the first 12.)

The 13 triplets give information about the location, order and time-coverage of
the chebychev polynomials corresponding to the following 13 items:

       Mercury
       Venus
       Earth-Moon barycenter
       Mars 
       Jupiter 
       Saturn
       Uranus
       Neptune
       Pluto
       Moon (geocentric)
       Sun
       Nutations
       Librations

Word (1,i) is the starting location in each data record of the chebychev 
coefficients belonging to the ith item.  Word (2,i) is the number of chebychev 
coefficients per component of the ith item, and Word (3,i) is the number of 
complete sets of coefficients in each data record for the ith item.

Data Records ("GROUP 1070")

These records contin the actual ephemeris data in the form of chebychev 
polynomials.

The first two double precision words in each data record contain

         Julian date of earliest data in record.
         Julian date of latest data in record.

The remaining data are chebychev position coefficients for each component of 
each body on the tape.  The chebychev coefficients for the planets represent 
the solar system barycentric positions of the centers of the planetary systems.

There are three cartesian components (x, y, z), for each of the items #1-11; 
there are two components for the 12th item, nutations : d(psi) and d(epsilon);
there are three components for the 13th item, librations : three euler angles.

Planetary positions are given in kilometers.  DE200 is nominally with respect 
to the mean equator and equinox of J2000, coinciding with the origin of FK5; 
DE403 and DE405 are with respect to the Int Cel Ref Frame.  The nutations and 
librations are given in radians.

         APPENDIX B : CDrom available from Willmann-Bell


The CD's containing DE200 and DE405 (unix and ascii) and also DE406 (unix only)
are available from Willmann-Bell.  The price is about $25 per disk.

There is an order form that calculates all costs to any country in the world 
on their web page (www.willbell.com).  On the home page there is an icon for 
this. The order form activates security for credit card transactions.  If one
does not want to order over the web, one can print the order form and fax or 
mail it to them.

I now have a limited supply of the ascii version of DE406.  I can lend these 
to those who need the full extended ephemeris and who can not use the unix 
version.

         APPENDIX C : Corrections to the software on the CDroms

   The enclosed are improvements to the software on the CDroms.
      (The ftp software on "navigator.jpl.nasa.gov" has been updated.)

1)  In "testeph.f" on both CDroms, line 95 should now be

      INTEGER LINE/0/

2)  In "testeph.f" on both CDroms, the statement at line 142 was

        DEL=DABS(R(NCOORD)-XI)/(DABS(R(NCOORD))+DABS(XI))

  it should be replaced by:

        DEL=DABS(R(NCOORD)-XI)
        if(ntarg .eq. 15 .and. ncoord .eq. 3)
       * del=del/(0.23d0*(et-2451545.d0))

3)  In "testeph.f" on both CDroms, the statement that was 
    at line 446 should now be

      IF(FIRST) CALL STATE(0.D0,0,0,0.D0)

4)  In "asc2eph.f" on both CDroms, the statement near line 190 was 

       READ (*,'(2I6,3000(/3D26.18))',IOSTAT =IN)
      .      NRW, NCOEFF, (DB(K),K=1,NCOEFF)

  it should replaced by:

    1  READ(*,'(2i6)')NRW,NCOEFF
       if(NRW .EQ. 0) GO TO 1
       READ (*,'(3D26.18)',IOSTAT =IN) (DB(K),K=1,NCOEFF)

5)  In "asc2eph.f" ***>> on the DE406 ascii CDrom only <<*** :

  "3D26.18" in line 268 should be replaced by "3D23.15"

6)  In "asc2eph.f" on both CDroms, the 4th from last line was

       READ (*, '(A)') BLANK

  it should now be:

       IF(HEADER .NE. 'GROUP   1070') READ (*, '(A)') BLANK

         APPENDIX D : Documentation of DE405 and DE406

DE405 Documentation is available from the anonymous ftp site, 
"navigator.jpl.nasa.gov", in the directory, "/usr1/ftp/ephem/export/de405.iom/", 

The memo is in two forms: 

  1) in a single complete PostScript file, "de405iom.ps", or in

  2) LaTeX file, "de405iom.tex" with the accompanying figures,
     "de405fig1.ps", ... "de405fig8.ps".

The memo for DE403 remains in the directory, "/usr1/ftp/ephem/export/de403.iom/":
 "de403iom.tex" along with the separate figures, "fig1.ps", ... "fig9.ps".

         APPENDIX E : C-versions of the software

There are various contributed C-versions of the reading routines.  All
responsibility for these resides with their authors, and all questions
pertaining to their use must be directed to the authors themselves.

  The first is from Kourosh Arfa-Kaboodvand at the Technical University of 
  Darmstadt; it is in the file, "/ftp/pub/ephem/export/C-versions/kourosh",
  and is described by the README in that file.

  The second comes from David Hoffman.  It also has a "README" and is found in
  the file, "/ftp/pub/ephem/export/C-versions/hoffman".

  There is also a set of C-based software by Dr. Piotr Dybczynski of the
  Astronomical Observatory in Poznan, Poland.  He has developed C versions
  of ASC2EPH and TESTEPH programs which are fully compatible with Fortran
  on PC-based machines so they can use the same binary files under both DOS
  and LINUX.  He has also developed software for converting the JPL Unix
  binary files into DOS/LINUX ones.  For further information about this
  C-version contact :
  Dr. Piotr A. Dybczynski; Internet: dybol@phys.amu.edu.pl
                         ftp: //ftp.astro.amu.edu.pl, IP: 150.254.66.60

===============================================================================

APPENDIX F : FITS version of the software

There is a FITS version of the ephemeris software, now available from 
Arnold Rots of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.  The directory contains 
a 00README along with the ephemerides in FITS format plus ANSI standard C code.
The ftp site is

    ftp://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xte/calib_data/clock/bary
