This directory contains the following files:

ascp2000.405        ASCII file for ephmerides from 2000 ro 2009
ascp2020.405        ASCII file for ephmerides from 2020 ro 2039
header.405          Header file to process the ASCII ephmeris files
README              explaining the format of the ASCII ephmeris files
READMEfirst         ...

The ASCII ephmeris files initially in this directory are just dummy files.
The working ASCII ephmeris files as well as the "header" and "README" files 
must be obtained from the following internet site:

"ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/export/ascii/ascp2000.405"
"ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/export/ascii/ascp2020.405"
"ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/export/ascii/header.405"
"ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/export/ascii/README"

Each of these ASCII ephmeris files contain the ephemerides for a period of 20 years.

To be useful these files must be converted into a binary ephemeris file,
which will be used for astronomical calculations to compile the Nautical Almanac.
This will be explained in the README file in the "../tools" directory.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is how I generated the binary ephemeris files for the time span 2000-2039:

The binary ephemeris file were generated using the "convert" and "append" programs of
David Hoffman as follows:

   0  install the programs of David Hoffman in the ../tools/ directory
   1  download the files "ascp2000.405", "ascp2020.405" and "header.405"
      from the JPL server into this directory. 
   2  Then convert both ASCII files into a corresponding binary file with the 
      programs of David Hoffman:

      % ../tools/convert header.405 ascp2000.405 ascp2000.bin
      % ../tools/convert header.405 ascp2020.405 ascp2020.bin

   3  Finally merge the binary files and renamed the resulting binary ephemeris file:

      % ../tools/append ascp2000.bin ascp2020.bin
      % mv ascp2000.bin ../JPLephemDE405.bin
      % rm ascp2020.bin

The binary file "JPLephemDE405.bin" contains the Tchebychev coefficients for the time
span 2000 to 2039 and is read by my version of "jplint.c" compiled into the program
../../NAlm/NauticalAlmanac (look there to see how to build this program).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the timespan 2000-2019 suffices then follow this procedure:


Generate the binary ephemeris file from the downloaded ASCII file:

   0  install the programs of David Hoffman in the ../tools/ directory
   1  download the file "ascp2000.405" and "header.405"
      from the JPL server into this directory.
   2  Then convert the ASCII ephemeris file into a corresponding binary file with the 
      program of David Hoffman:

      % ../tools/convert header.405 ascp2000.405 ascp2000.bin

   3  Finally rename the resulting binary ephemeris file:

      % mv ascp2000.bin ../JPLephemDE405.bin

The binary file "JPLephemDE405.bin" contains the Tchebychev coefficients for the time
span 2000 to 2019 and is read by my version of "jplint.c" compiled into the program
../../NAlm/NauticalAlmanac (look there to see how to build this program).
